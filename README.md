Solar System Simulator

This project presents an interactive, real-time 3D Solar System Simulator, meticulously crafted using the powerful Three.js library. It offers a captivating journey through our cosmic neighborhood, allowing users to explore a dynamically animated model of our solar system where planets orbit a central star and rotate on their own axes. Leveraging advanced features like high-resolution textures for realism, dynamic lighting with shadows, raycasting for object selection, and post-processing for a stunning solar bloom, the application provides a rich and polished user experience. As a comprehensive demonstration of modern web-based graphics, this simulator showcases a deep understanding of 3D rendering principles, object-oriented JavaScript, and user-centric interactive design.
